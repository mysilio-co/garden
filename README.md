# Mysilio Garden

Garden is a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden), a micro-publishing space for you to plant the seeds
of your ideas and grow them into bi-directionally linked web portals. It's a social
[zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/) that lets users use [Web
Monetization](https://webmonetization.org/) to get paid when people
spend time with their content.

Mysilio Garden is built on [Solid](https://solidproject.org/), a new open standard for decentralized identity and data storage. Mysilio runs a Solid POD host where you can store your data, but you can use our hosted version of Mysilio Garden with and Community Solid Server-based POD host. Support for Inrupt's Pod Spaces (https://docs.inrupt.com/pod-spaces/) is planned - if you'd like to contribute to the effort to add this support please let us know!

If you'd like to take Mysilio Garden for a spin, check out our hosted instance at [mysilio.garden](https://mysilio.garden)
